            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 sticks unsalted butter (room temperature)</li>
            <li>¾ cup granulated sugar/li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Unwrap caramel squares and cut each square into fours. Then, roll each small caramel square into a ball.</li>
            <li>Whisk 8 ½ ounces of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of kosher salt. Set aside for later. </li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, place 2 sticks of unsalted butter (room temperature), ¾ cup of granulated sugar, and a firmly packed ¾ cup of brown sugar. Using a stand mixer, mix the ingredients together and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>After about one minute or after all of the ingredients are mixed together, add 2 large eggs to the mixture.   </li>
            <li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix for about 1-2 minutes or until the mixture is a creamy texture.</li>
            <li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl one last time and then add the dry ingredients to the mixture. Mix for no more than 30-45 seconds. Be sure not to over mix unless you want tough cookies.  </li>
            <li>Add your chopped up caramel squares, chocolate chips, and peanut butter chips to the mixture. Make sure to scrape the cookie dough out of the paddle attachment. </li>
            <li>Use a tiny ice cream scoop or melon baller to scoop out uniform little nubbins (1 Tablespoon worth) of the cookie dough and space out the scoops evenly on a parchment lined baking sheet.  </li>
            <li>Place into a 375°F oven for 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>After taking the cookies out of the oven, make sure not to try and scrape the cookies off the parchment paper until they are cooled completely as the molten caramel will make the cookies stick to the paper like glue. </li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
