            <li>2 lbs flank steak</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>

            <li>1 bunch cilantro</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp kosher salt</li>

        <h2>Carne Asada Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, add ¼ cup each of lemon juice, vegetable oil, soy sauce, and chicken stock with ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon of ground cumin, ¼ cup of white sugar, 2 crushed cloves of garlic, a bunch of chopped cilantro, and a tablespoon each of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Whisk together to combine.</li>
            <li>Into a large bowl or pan, place in the 2 lbs of flank steak, and cover with the marinade making sure every inch is evenly coated. Cover and fridge for 4 hours. Flip once or twice through the process.</li>
            <li>After 4 hours of marinating, remove some of the excess herbs and garlic from the steak to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>On a well oiled and preheated cast iron (once wisps of smoke appear), place the flank steak onto the cast iron leaving undisturbed for about 5 minutes until the first side has developed a dark brown char. Flip and repeat.</li>
            <li>If not ready to serve, place into a low heated oven to keep warm until ready to prepare.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Start by deboning, deskinning, and defatting the pork shoulder. Remove as much meat off the bone as possible. Cut the meat into 2-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>In a large, wide dutch oven, add in 2 lbs of lard along with 1 cup of water over medium-high heat until the lard is completely melted.</li>
            <li>Slowly and carefully add in the pork along with the juice and flesh of 2 large navel oranges cut in half. Bring to a bare simmer.</li>
            <li>Once simmering, lower the heat to medium-low and maintain a bare simmer for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>After the first hour, remove the pieces of orange and replace it with ½ a large onion roughly chopped, 4 large cloves of crushed garlic, 4 dried bay leaves, 2 sticks of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds, and 1 tablespoon of Mexican oregano. Mix together before adding in ½ cup each of light Mexican beer and evaporated milk. Mix together.</li>

            <li>After 2 hours, remove the carnitas from the pot and place it in the fridge until ready to use. When ready to use, simply reheat the carnitas and serve.</li>
